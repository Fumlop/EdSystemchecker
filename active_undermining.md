# Active Undermining Analysis Report

**Report Generated:** 2025-07-25 18:07:05
**Analysis Threshold:** Systems with CP difference ≥ 100

## Data Sources

- **Exploited**: 455 systems (updated: 2025-07-25 18:04:34)
- **Fortified**: 130 systems (updated: 2025-07-25 18:04:34)
- **Stronghold**: 55 systems (updated: 2025-07-25 18:04:34)

## Summary

- **Systems >25% Progress:** 0 systems showing undermining activity
- **Systems ≤25% Progress:** 0 systems showing activity
- **Total Systems Analyzed:** 640

## Analysis Method

### Systems >25% Progress
- **Natural Decay Applied:** These systems experience natural influence decay
- **CP Difference:** Actual CP minus Expected CP (after natural decay)
- **Positive Difference:** More CP than expected = Active undermining/fortification
- **Negative Difference:** Less CP than expected = Possible preparation activity

### Systems ≤25% Progress
- **No Natural Decay:** These systems maintain their progress
- **Expected = Actual:** Under normal circumstances
- **Any Difference:** Indicates recent activity (undermining/fortification)

## Systems >25% Progress (Natural Decay Applied)

**No systems >25% showing significant undermining activity**

## Systems ≤25% Progress (No Natural Decay)

**No systems ≤25% showing significant activity**
